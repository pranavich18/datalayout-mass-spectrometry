## Space- and time-efficient data format for mass spectrometry data (OpenMS) GSOC'22

### Current State of Progress w.r.t. Project after the coding period
Currently I have 2 PRs for the project. 

1. [SoA Datalayout](https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS/pull/6190)

First one was an attempt to implement normal Structure of Arrays for MSSpectrum without any zero-cost abstraction. It was successfully implemented for a few functions of MSSPectrum like `getBasePeak()` , along with iterators termed as `ProxyIterator`.
But the problem arose in the implementation of MSSpectrum in other classes in the OpenMS Codebase. In the implementation iterator was just an abstraction of index and the could not return a reference to a `Peak1D` object. Here it was a point where we got stuck with the first approach and also the non-const usage of AreaIterator also started throwing build errors at this point.

2. [SoA Datalayout with Abstraction](https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS/pull/6267)

This time one of my mentors came with an idea to implement it with the abstraction template that we were planning to use before. Earlier the swap() function was a bottleneck for this but its implementation was changed using a custom swap for reference_wrappers.
This PR uses a zero-cost abstraction for a Structure of Array (SoA) data layout for `MSSpectrum`. In this implementation MSSpectrum uses the abstraction datalayout in the form of a `BaseContainer` which stores `Peak1D` as a tupleof values i.e. `Peak1DT<>` with almost all the functionalities of a vector<Peak> like, `insert()` , `empty()` , `erase` , `front` , `back` , `emplace_back` , `push_back` , `pop_back` , etc. all the ones which were being used in the original vector<Peak1D>.

The new data layout support proper iterators which return the reference to the Peak object.
For peaks we used a tuple of values(position and intensities). The new iterator solves the problem that we faced in the first approach. 

This implementation was successfully tested and build with some of the functions changed separately. Now the MSSpectrum inherits from the SoA that was created in the abstraction temoplate.
But due to the entanglement of MSSpectrum with a lot of classes , currently there are build errors getting thrown. Some of the other classes for eg: `AreaIterator` was changed along with its template parameters to support the new changes of MSSpectrum.
Build errors w.r.t some files are already fixed but still there are some yet to be fixed.

### Why the Project could not be completed?

There were several factors for it. This was my very first time working with advanced C++ for development. So I was a slow learner and had a lot of doubts related to the build errors that I was facing. And hence it took me some time to come to terms with it and understand the codebase from the build perspective. 

 Due to the huge dependency of the MSSpectrum class in other classes, the respective template specializations in other classes had to be adapted as well. There was no way I could find of compiling and building MSSpectrum independently from other classes to compare its performance hence, I had to implement everything along with other classes using the changed MSSpectrum class. So even for small changes after a certain period of time, a lot of build errors started to come. And the build errors are still coming up. This is happening maybe because of the vastness of the OpenMS codebase and even if small changes are introduced in a deeply used class, it can lead to a lot of breaking changes.  Since I was a newbie to the codebase it took me time and a lot of help from the mentors to fix the build errors. At times, maybe I became over reliant on my mentor’s input.  I tried my best to fix the errors but I was not able to do so for all of them in the given timeframe because of the exploratory and experimental nature of the project. 
 
But on the other hand, the foundations for the zero cost abstraction have been laid and this can be built upon and extended. Though I found the going challenging at times, I’ve tried my best every week to learn and grasp the components in the codebase and I’ve tried to build upon my learnings.

### Future Plan

The foundation of the abstraction w.r.t MSSpectrum class has been laid.  There are some changes required in the implementation of functions in MSSpectrum. But before moving onto that we need to fix the build errors that are being thrown right now. After the build errors are being fixed, changes w.r.t MSSpectrum member functions needs to be done. This will mark the successful completion and transformation of MSSpectrum to SoA (Structure of Arrays) data layout. I was not able to get an extension before the submission period. But if possible i would still want to contribute to this as an Open-Source contribution to the OBF and OpenMS community and complete it because this was my first step in Open-Source and it made me learn and gain knowledge about a lot of things.

### Coding Period ends after Week 12

### Week 12 - 29th to 4th September

- I will also be looking in the MS SPectrum class and it's usage to get a more clear understanding and will be posting doubts on the community platform.

### About the Project ([Link to the Project Idea](https://www.open-bio.org/events/gsoc/gsoc-project-ideas/))
In this project, we need to implement a zero-cost abstraction using Modern C++, which can help us to switch between Structure of Arrays (SoA) and Array of Structures (AoS). This abstraction needs to be introduced at MSSpectrum and MSChromatogram levels. These are the 2 classes used in OpenMS, which currently uses vector<Peak1D> i.e. an Array of Structures.
