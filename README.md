## Space- and time-efficient data format for mass spectrometry data (OpenMS) GSOC'22

### Schedule for 2nd Week 30th May to 5th June

- Play around with Crosetto's abstraction with my own self-defined MSSpectrum class.
- Study the details about abstraction.


Will update more in a short while..

### Schedule for 1st Week 23rd May to 29th May

- Setting up a fresh development environment for the project.
- Along with that I will start revising the Zero Cost Abstraction by crosetto ([here](https://github.com/crosetto/SoAvsAoS)).
- I will also be looking in the MS SPectrum class and it's usage to get a more clear understanding and will be posting doubts on the community platform.

### About the Project ([Link to the Project Idea](https://www.open-bio.org/events/gsoc/gsoc-project-ideas/))
In this project, we need to implement a zero-cost abstraction using Modern C++, which can help us to switch between Structure of Arrays (SoA) and Array of Structures (AoS). This abstraction needs to be introduced at MSSpectrum and MSChromatogram levels. These are the 2 classes used in OpenMS, which currently uses vector<Peak1D> i.e. an Array of Structures.
